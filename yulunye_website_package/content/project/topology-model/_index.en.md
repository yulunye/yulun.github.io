This project presents a mathematical framework to study non-autonomous topology propagation systems, inspired by viral spread models during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Key Objectives
- Predict virus spread routes using propagation systems
- Model propagation using 2×2 matrices
- Define autonomous vs. non-autonomous spread models
- Analyze survival and communication properties (survival-I, survival-II, mixing, transitivity)
- Extend to hybrid matrix systems and classify them via irreducibility and primitivity

### Outcomes
- Identified stable long-term propagation behavior using recursive formulas
- Proved relationships between matrix structure and communication properties
- Laid the groundwork to expand the model to 3×3 matrices and real-world applications
